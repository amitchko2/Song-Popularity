# Song-Popularity
Relationship between language and formality in popular songs. 
Instructions: To access and utilize the script, open the "mitchka1-final_projectI.R" file, which contains the code for my project. To access the dataset, open the "data.csv" file.

Operationalization 
To operationalize the level of formality, I went onto Spotify and looked at the lyrics for each song. I did the same for finding the language of the song, going to Spotify and listening to the song as well as reading the lyrics.
