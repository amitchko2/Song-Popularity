# Song-Popularity
Relationship between language and formality in popular songs. 

Instructions: To access and utilize the script, open the "mitchka1-final_projectI.R" file, which contains the code for my project. To access the dataset, open the "data.csv" file.

Data: The data collected for this project was from a list of 200 popular songs from a variety of artists and genres. I analyzed each song by looking at their lyrics to determine formal or  informal language, paying attention to things such as slang, different types of language and vocabulary. This allowed to see the relationship between language use and popularity of the song., 

Operationalization 
To operationalize the level of formality, I went onto Spotify and looked at the lyrics for each song. I did the same for finding the language of the song, going to Spotify and listening to the song as well as reading the lyrics.
